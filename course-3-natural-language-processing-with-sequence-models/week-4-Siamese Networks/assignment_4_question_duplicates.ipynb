It has the cosine similarity of V1[2] and V2[x]. The *closest_negative*, as was arranged, is V2[2] which has a score of 1. This is the maximum value of the 'negative' entries (blue entries in the diagram).\n",

To avoid selecting the 'positive'/green entries, we can make them larger negative numbers. Multiply `fastnp.eye(batch_size)` with 2.0 and subtract it out of `scores`. The result is `negative_without_positive`. Now we can use `fastnp.max`, row by row (axis=1), to select the maximum which is `closest_negative`.\n",

We can use `fastnp.eye(batch_size)` and a constant, this time to create a mask with zeros on the diagonal. Element-wise multiply this with `score` to get just the 'negative values. This is `negative_zero_on_duplicate` in the code. Compute the mean by using `fastnp.sum` on `negative_zero_on_duplicate` for `axis=1` and divide it by `(batch_size - 1)` . This is `mean_negative`.\n",
