        "Trax is similar to other popular NN development platforms such as Keras (now integrated into Tensorflow) and Pytorch in that it uses 'layers' as a useful level of abstraction. Layers are often represented as *classes*. We're going to improve our understanding of Trax by locally extending the classes used in the attention layers. We will extend only the 'forward' functions and utilize the existing attention layers as parent classes. The original code can be found at [github:trax/layers/Research/Efficient_attention](https://github.com/google/trax/blob/v1.3.4/trax/layers/research/efficient_attention.py). This link references release 1.3.4 but note that this is under the 'research' directory as this is an area of active research.

EfficientAttentionBase leaves many routines to be overridden by child classes - but it has an important feature in the *Forward* routine. It supports a `use_reference_code` capability that selects implementations that limit some of the complexities to provide a more easily understood version of the algorithms. In particular, it implements a nested loop that treats each *'example, head'* independently. This simplifies our work as we need only worry about matrix operations on one *'example, head'* at a time. This loop calls *forward_unbatched*, which is the child process that we will be overriding.\n",

We will describe the inputs as *embeddings* assuming an NLP application, however, this is not required. This matrix multiply very much like a convolutional network where a set of weights (a filter) slide across the input vectors leaving behind a map of the similarity of the input to the filter. In this case, the filters are the weight matrices $W^Q$ and $W^K$. The resulting maps are Q and K. Q and K have the dimensions of (n_seq, n_q) where n_seq is the number input embeddings and n_q or n_k is the selected size of the Q or K vectors. Note the shading of Q and K, this reflects the fact that each entry is associated with a particular input embedding. You will note later in the code that K is optional. Apparently, similar results can be achieved using Query alone saving the compute and storage associated with K. In that case, the dot-product in *attend* is matmul(q,q). Note the resulting dot-product (*Dot*) entries describe a complete (n_seq,n_seq) map of the similarity of all entries of q vs all entries of k. This is reflected in the notation in the dot-product boxes of $w_n$,$w_m$ representing word_n, word_m.

        "The larger the matrix multiply in the previous section is, the more context can be taken into account when making the next decision. However, the self attention dot product grows as the size of the input squared. For example, if one wished to have an input size of 1024, that would result in $1024^2$ or over a million dot products for each head! As a result, there has been significant research related to reducing the compute requirements. One such approach is Locality Sensitive Hashing(LSH) Self Attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "You may recall, earlier in the course you utilized LSH to find similar tweets without resorting to calculating cosine similarity for each pair of embeddings. We will use a similar approach here. It may be best described with an example.\n",

        "LSH Self attention uses Queries only, no Keys. Attention then generates a metric of the similarity of each value of Q relative to all the other values in Q. An earlier assignment demonstrated that values which hash to the same bucket are likely to be similar. Further, multiple random hashes can improve the chances of finding entries which are similar. This is the approach taken here, though the hash is implemented a bit differently. The values of Q are hashed into buckets using a randomly generated set of hash vectors.  Multiple sets of hash vectors are used, generating multiple hash tables. In the figure above, we have 3 hash tables with 4 buckets in each table. Notionally,  following the hash, the values of Q have been replicated 3 times and distributed to their appropriate bucket in each of the 3 tables. To find similarity then, one generates dot-products only between members of the buckets. The result of this operation provides information on which entries are similar. As the operation has been distributed over multiple hash tables, these results need to be combined to form a complete picture and this can be used to generate a reduced dot-product attention array. Its clear that because we do not do a compare of every value vs every other value, the size of *Dots* will be reduced.\n",
        "\n",
        "The challenge in this approach is getting it to operate efficiently. You may recall from the earlier assignments the buckets were lists of entries and had varying length. This will operate poorly on a vector processing machine such as a GPU or TPU. Ideally, operations are done in large blocks with uniform sizes. While it is straightforward to implement the hash algorithm this way, it is challenging to managed buckets and variable sized dot-products. This will be discussed further below. For now, we will examine and implement the hash function."

I'm sure at this point you are wondering what happens if the number of entries in a bucket is not evenly distributed the way our example is. It is possible, for example for all of the `seqlen` entries to land in one bucket. Further, since the buckets are not aligned, our 'chunks' may be misaligned with the start of the bucket. The implementation addresses this by attending to adjacent chunks as was described in the lecture:\n",
